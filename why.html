    <h1>Why I Built FounderOS</h1>
    <p>I built FounderOS because early-stage founders don’t need more dashboards — they need peace of mind. </p>
    <p>This project started after watching a founder friend buried in physical mail and scattered tools. Operations were taking up their creative energy. I wanted to build the quiet infrastructure layer — the one that just runs.</p>
    <p>FounderOS is the first step toward that. Invisible support. Designed for calm.</p>
