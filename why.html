      <h1>Why I Built FounderOS</h1>
      
      <p>Startups are the fun kind of chaos. The high-velocity, whiteboard-filled, scrappy kind. The kind that makes you fall in love with building.</p>
      
      <p>But between the brainstorms and breakthroughs, there's the chaos that just... grinds you down.</p>
      
      <p>The unglamorous kind — scattered W-9s, forgotten 1099s, surprise compliance fees, investor updates you meant to send last week.</p>
      
      <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="Madeleine Martini" class="founder-photo">
      
      <p>I've felt that pressure firsthand — building internal tools at Seed, scaling ops at Lime and Built In, helping high-growth teams at Bumble stay on track.</p>
      
      <p>Now I support 30+ startups in Cincinnati through venture — and one day I walked up to a founder friend in our portfolio who had literal piles of paper spread out around him. I asked what he was doing.</p>
      
      <p>He just looked up and laughed: "Paperwork."</p>
      
      <p>That moment stuck with me.</p>
      
      <p>Because most founders aren't dropping the ball out of carelessness — they're just buried in things that shouldn't require their brainpower in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>So I started paying closer attention. The patterns were everywhere:</p>
      
      <ul class="pattern-list">
        <li>Founders manually onboarding contractors</li>
        <li>Paying late fees on filings they didn't know were due</li>
        <li>Copy-pasting metrics into investor updates at 11pm</li>
        <li>Winging operations because they didn't have time to build systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I built FounderOS to quietly take care of all of that.</p>
      
      <p>Not with another dashboard. Not with a todo list. But with an invisible operating layer that connects to the tools you already use — and just gets it done.</p>
      
      <div class="final-cta">
        <p>FounderOS handles the stuff that's not worth your time — but too risky to ignore.</p>
        <p>No chaos. No checklists. No Sunday scaries.</p>
        <p>Just calm momentum in the background.</p>
